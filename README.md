# Learn functional programming: a Rubyist's list

Hi! I'm on a journey to learn functional programming (FP). Won't you join me?

If you notice any broken links here, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-functional-programming/issues/new).

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of FP resources, only my path to learning some FP and applying it to Ruby.

## Haskell

Because it's as FP as FP gets. I don't expect to build anything impressive in Haskell, but it seems like a good language to learn new ways of thinking just by doing small exercises.

### Community

Places to ask questions when I get stuck.

- [Functional Programming Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/K6XHBSh)
- [Haskell - Community page](https://www.haskell.org/community/)

### Reference

- [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/). Since its search uses a query param, you can add a search keyword to your browser to let you quickly search from the address bar, for example `hs partition` would take you to [https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=partition](https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=partition)

### Projects

- [ ] Rewrite my Ruby gem [Reading](https://github.com/fpsvogel/reading) in Haskell. I doubt that I'll actually maintain the Haskell rewrite, but at least I'll use the experience to learn how to make the Ruby original more robust.

## Elixir

Because it's a different take on FP: less pure and with unique advantages offered by the BEAM platform. (But these advantages are not yet completely realized, i.e. it's a work in progress, according to the talk [The Soul of Erlang & Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE).)

## FP in Ruby

Because I enjoy Ruby and the whole point of learning FP is not to switch to some other stack, but to become a better programmer in any language.

### "Functional lite": prefer immutability and avoid side effects

- [Avoid Mutation â€” Functional Style in Ruby](https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/avoid-mutation-functional-style-in-ruby/)
- [Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)
- Sandi Metz ([source](https://dev.to/sandimetz/comment/255m)): "I only have a small bit of experience with functional languages, so I don't get to have much of an opinion. I can say, however, that immutability and no side-effects are great ideas, and that I've borrowed them for my OO. My initial goal for every new object I write is that it not change, and that it not have side effects. This obviously can't suit every object, but I've been pleasantly surprised about how much can be done under these constraints, and how much the constraints simplify code."
- Avdi Grimm ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20201009182546/https://github.com/yct21/observatory/issues/93)): "Functional programming ideas about preferring immutability and isolating interactions with the outside world can help us avoid the worst pitfalls of procedural and object-oriented coding. But trying to program in a *'fully FP'* style in Ruby can be like paddling a kayak with a canoe paddle. Upstream. [â€¦] Your best bet for effective development is to learn to 'code with the grain' [of the language you're using]. And when you get right down to it, Ruby's grain is object-oriented."

### Hanami/dry-rb ecosystem
