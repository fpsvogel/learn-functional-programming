# Learn functional programming: a Rubyist's list

Hi! I'm on a journey to learn functional programming (FP). Won't you join me?

If you notice any broken links here, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-functional-programming/issues/new).

This list is not meant to be an exhaustive guide to learning FP, only my path to learning some FP and applying it to Ruby. Before I narrowed its focus, the list [used to have](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-functional-programming/commit/c53a86ff1f39977dec451a5f34702602abf009de) sections on Haskell, Clojure, and other languages.
