# Learn functional programming: a Rubyist's list

Hi! I'm on a journey to learn functional programming (FP). Won't you join me?

If you notice any broken links here, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-functional-programming/issues/new).

## Roc

I originally started with Haskell, but it was a bit of a slog. [The raw file of this list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpsvogel/learn-functional-programming/main/README.md) still contains commented-out sections for Haskell and Elixir (another one I *probably* won't learn).

Roc seems like an easier place to start because it's intentionally small and tries to incorporate some of the strengths of dynamic languages, while being fully statically typed.

### Reference

- [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/). Since its search uses a query param, you can add a search keyword to your browser to let you quickly search from the address bar, for example `hs partition` would take you to [https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=partition](https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=partition)

<!-- ## Elixir

Because it's a different take on FP: less pure and with unique advantages offered by the BEAM platform. (But these advantages are not yet completely realized, i.e. it's a work in progress, according to the talk [The Soul of Erlang & Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE).)

## FP in non-FP languages

Because my goal in learning FP is not to switch to a different stack, but to become a better programmer in the languages that I use now.

### Ruby

- "Functional lite": prefer immutability and avoid side effects
  - [Avoid Mutation â€” Functional Style in Ruby](https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/avoid-mutation-functional-style-in-ruby/)
  - [Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)
  - Sandi Metz ([source](https://dev.to/sandimetz/comment/255m)): "I only have a small bit of experience with functional languages, so I don't get to have much of an opinion. I can say, however, that immutability and no side-effects are great ideas, and that I've borrowed them for my OO. My initial goal for every new object I write is that it not change, and that it not have side effects. This obviously can't suit every object, but I've been pleasantly surprised about how much can be done under these constraints, and how much the constraints simplify code."
  - Avdi Grimm ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20201009182546/https://github.com/yct21/observatory/issues/93)): "Functional programming ideas about preferring immutability and isolating interactions with the outside world can help us avoid the worst pitfalls of procedural and object-oriented coding. But trying to program in a *'fully FP'* style in Ruby can be like paddling a kayak with a canoe paddle. Upstream. [â€¦] Your best bet for effective development is to learn to 'code with the grain' [of the language you're using]. And when you get right down to it, Ruby's grain is object-oriented."
