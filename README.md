# Learn functional programming: a Rubyist's list

Hi! I'm on a journey to learn functional programming (FP). Won't you join me?

If you notice any broken links here, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-functional-programming/issues/new).

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of FP resources, only my path to learning some FP and applying it to Ruby.

- [ ] [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) as an example project outside of web dev.
